//To know more info in Kmeans-Cluster:https://www.javatpoint.com/k-means-clustering-algorithm-in-machine-learning
You are requested to implement the k means algorithm using the open MP function.

1. Number of data points is known (you are flexible to define how many data points you
would use in your program).

2. The datapoint are in 2 dimension i.e, each point is represented as (x,y)

3. You would use only openMP apis. You shouldnâ€™t use mpi apis.

4. You should read your points from the data file in your c script (points are defined by you).
5. The program output is as follow
Cluster 1:
(x1,y1)
(x2, y2)
Where x is the location of point in x dimension and y is the location of point in y
dimension and cluster is in which cluster this point belongs to.
6. Number of threads equals the number of clusters you will pass to the program.
7. You are flexible to choose the number of times the algorithm should be repeated until
you reach your stopping criteria (you have flexibility to choose maximum number of
iteration and/or choose the threshold of centroid difference error ).
8. To calculate the distance use the mean square error equation.
